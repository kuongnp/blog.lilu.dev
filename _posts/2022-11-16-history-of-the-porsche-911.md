Undeniably, the most influential and popular Porsche model, the 911 has made a big name for itself over the years. It first came into production in 1963 and over its 50+ year history has gone through some remarkable changes.

Based on the classic Porsche 356, the 911 kept a similar fastback design. It was equipped with an air-cooled flat-six engine that produced 130 brake horsepower (bhp). In 1965, Porsche began production of the 912, which was aimed at being a less expensive version of the 911. It only lasted until 1969. 1965 also saw the introduction of the 911 Targa. This innovative design had a removable roof panel with a protective rollbar behind the driver.

With the dawn of a new decade, the 911 received an engine upgrade. The 1970 model came with a 2.2-liter engine in addition to lightweight aluminum engine lids and bumpers. By 1972, output was increased to 190 bhp, making the 911 both quick and agile.

The first Carrera RS model came into being in 1973. It was designed as a race car for the FIA Group 4 class. With its 2.7-liter flat-six engine, it was rated at 210 bhp. It utilized both mechanical fuel injection and its iconic ducktail spoiler.

In the 1980s, the 911 Carrera models continued to get more powerful, faster, and sleeker. A turbocharged engine was introduced in 1990 for the 964 Turbo model. This 3.3-liter engine made 315 bhp. In 1995, we got the last air-cooled 911s in the form of the 993. Many people regard this model as one of the best 911s ever.

As Porsche moved into the new millennium, the 911 models got smoother styling and more powerful engines. The 2001 996 GT2 came with a twin-turbo engine that produced an impressive 476 bhp. It had a top speed of 198 mph. In the current 911 lineup, you can find a variety of models that offers track-ready performance or just thrills for everyday driving.
