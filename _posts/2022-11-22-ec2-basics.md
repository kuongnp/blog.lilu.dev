### Amazon EC2
* EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
* EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
* It mainly consists in the capability of :
    * Renting virtual machines (EC2)
    * Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
    * Distributing load across machines (ELB)
    * Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

* Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

### EC2 sizing & configuration options
* Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
* How much compute power & cores (CPU)
* How much random-access memory (RAM)
* How much storage space:
    * Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
    * hardware (EC2 Instance Store)

* Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
* Firewall rules: **security group**
* Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

### EC2 User Data
* It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script. 
* bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
* That script is only run once at the instance first start
* EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
    * Installing updates
    * Installing software
    * Downloading common files from the internet
    * Anything you can think of

* The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

### EC2 Instance Types - Overview

### EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
* Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
* Balance between: 
    * Compute
    * Memory
    * Networking

### EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized
* Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
    * Batch processing workloads
    * Media transcoding
    * High performance web servers
    * High performance computing (HPC)
    * Scientific modeling & machine learning
    * Dedicated gaming servers

### EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized
* Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
* Use cases:
    * High performance, relational/non-relational databases
    * Distributed web scale cache stores
    * In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
    * Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

### EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized
* Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
* Use cases:
    * High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
    * Relational & NoSQL databases
    * Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
    * Data warehousing applications
    * Distributed file systems

### Introduction to Security Groups
* Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
* They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.

* Security groups only contain allow rules
* Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
* Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
* They regulate:
    * Access to Ports
    * Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
    * Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
    * Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

### Security Groups Good to know
* Can be attached to multiple instances
* Locked down to a region / VPC combination
* Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
* It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
* If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
* If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched
* All inbound traffic is blocked by default
* All outbound traffic is authorised by default

### Classic Ports to know
* 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
* 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
* 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
* 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
* 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
* 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance
*
