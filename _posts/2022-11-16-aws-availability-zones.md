* Each region has many availability zones
(usually 3, min is 2, max is 6). Example:
* ap-southeast-2a
* ap-southeast-2b
* ap-southeast-2c

Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more
discrete data centers with redundant power,
networking, and connectivity
• They’re separate from each other, so that
they’re isolated from disasters
• They’re connected with high bandwidth,
ultra-low latency networking
