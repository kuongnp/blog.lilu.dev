* AWS has Regions all around the world 
* Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3… 
* A region is a cluster of data centers 
* Most AWS services are region-scoped

How to choose an AWS Region?
* Compliance with data governance and legal
requirements: data never leaves a region without
your explicit permission
* Proximity to customers: reduced latency
* Available services within a Region: new services
and new features aren’t available in every Region
* Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is
transparent in the service pricing page
